# Latest QA Handoff

## Reviewed Implementation

Reviewed the Employee onboarding gate, backend device revocation response, API cold-start pairing flow, Electron IPC/context isolation, DPAPI credential persistence, runtime/tray/auto-start behavior, privacy copy, Electron Builder/NSIS configuration, ASAR resource paths, final executable, and existing foreground tracking regressions.

## Findings

- High external release requirement: the website still points to the old 0.4.0 ZIP until the 0.5.0 EXE is uploaded and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKMAP_DESKTOP_AGENT_URL` is changed.
- Medium production risk: final installer is Authenticode `NotSigned`; SmartScreen is expected until a signing certificate is configured.
- Medium accepted platform constraint: a browser may download an EXE but cannot launch it automatically. The Employee must open the installer once.
- Fixed: old 10-second pairing timeout now pre-warms Render and provides longer bounded timeouts and GUI progress.
- Fixed: revoked or Browser Extension devices cannot unlock the Desktop Agent onboarding requirement.
- Fixed: temporary visual-QA screenshot code was removed; no screenshot/title collection capability remains.

## Test And Verification Status

- Desktop Agent: typecheck pass, lint pass, 13/13 tests pass, NSIS build pass, packaged runtime smoke pass.
- Web: typecheck pass, lint pass, production build pass.
- API: typecheck pass, lint pass, independent output build pass, 9/9 tests pass.
- GUI visual QA: pass for the unpaired screen using Electron-rendered capture; final packaged process/window smoke also passed.
- Secret scan, screenshot/title capability scan, and `git diff --check`: pass.

## Manual QA Status

- Not yet run with a real Employee pairing code on a separate Windows computer.
- Required after deployment: installer launch, pair progress, website unlock, tray/background behavior, Windows sign-in auto-start, Owner live report, minimized/background exclusion, short-app exclusion, graceful stop, and forced interruption.

## Recommendation

Code and local release gates pass. Proceed to controlled deployment/manual QA, but do not call the Agent broadly production-ready until Authenticode signing and the separate-computer workflow pass.
